                    One of the holiest pilgrimages in India, Haridwar, or the ‘gateway to gods’, is located where Ganga, the sacredest of all Indian rivers, enters the Indo-Gangetic plains. Located at the foothills of the Himalayas, Haridwar is a city of temples and ashrams and its pious ambience envelops everyone. Haridwar is one of the four holy Indian cities that host the Kumbh Mela, a pious gathering of millions of Hindu devotees every 12 years. The Ardh Kumbh is organised here every six years. It also hosts the Kanwar mela every year during the rainy season. The ‘Panch8Tirth’ or the five pilgrimages located within the periphery of Haridwar, are Gangadwara (Har Ki Pauri), Kushwart (Ghat), Kankhal, Bilwa Tirtha (Mansa Devi Temple) and Neel Parvat (Chandi Devi). Haridwar serves as the gateway to the Char Dham of Uttarakhand as well. 
                    <br>
                    An ancient city, Haridwar's roots are steeped deep in culture and traditions of the ancient Vedic times, and                    there are several institutions here imparting traditional knowledge of wellness. If you want to know more and               experience the ancient methods of healing, there are many certified Ayurvedic clinics in Haridwar that you can                  visit. Ashrams also offer sessions in Ayurveda, meditation and yoga. Every morning and evening, the ghats               (stepped banks of a river) of River Ganga witnesses the blissful Ganga aarti, which attracts devotees and           tourists. The evening ritual being more popular, it makes for a mesmeric sight to see the river being venerated            with loud and rhythmic chants and tall lamps, their lights lightening up the darkening waters. It is a               spectacular sight as thousands of small diyas (earthen lamps) are set afloat on the river.

The town, built around the revered Kedarnath temple, is located at an altitude of 3,580 m, near Chorabari glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini river. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the ancient temple has exquisite architecture and is built of extremely large but evenly shaped grey stone slabs. A conical rock formation inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his “Sadashiva” form.  The Kedarnath temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva, is a part of Char Dham pilgrimage circuit, and is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva in India. Behind the Kedarnath temple, stand the Kedarnath peak, Kedar Dome and other Himalayan peaks.

                    The historical name of this region is "Kedar Khand" and legend says, the Pandavas from the epic Mahabharata,after having defeated the Kauravas, felt guilty of having killed so many people and sought the blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. The Lord eluded them repeatedly and took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bull.The Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations. The arms of the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and four above mentioned shrines make the revered Panch Kedar pilgrimage circuit
